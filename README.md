Block 9 - "3d-parties" part 1  

Using the "jetpack" library I used the navigation bottom bar, 

which I filled with three fragments, animation was added to 

the first of them using the "lottie" libraries, 

the second fragment makes a test crash of the application 

and sends the corresponding data to Firebase Crashlytics, 

the third fragment is just tells you about the upcoming Halloween holiday.
